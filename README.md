  <p><h6><b> Monday, September 22, 2014 </p></h6></b>
  <p>So I had planned on doing this yesterday, but it fell through. It fell so hard that it particularly fell the China. I adressed a few particular issues, first of which, is that this is going to be unedited. I'm doing this unedited, this is raw unedited shit that pours out through my mouth onto my fingers and the weight triggers the keys on my keyboard. Some entries will be short, some will be long but I will try to update this thing at least once a week. Especially with my progress reports. If you like well thought out grammar and sentence structure then please, go away. If you want my personal experiences mixed with an ass load of adventure, mystery and fun. Please, read on. </p>
  <p> Right! Now that we got that out of the way (I'll have another document in this, also I'll probably fork this if I make extra series blah.. blah.. blah) it's time to talk about me. This is going to be mostly the fucking, i'm me so let me tell you about me. It will probably be longer but who gives a fuck really? Anyway, I live in Eastern Michigan. In a small house in the suburbs, I have a keen sense of adventure. I persue adventure whenever I can and I love every minute of this whacky adventure we call life. I go to college at a small community college here, I want to produce a podcast but that may take a while. My current goal is to buy a go-pro, and you guys will know the fucking millosecond that happens. I will record everything. It will be amazing, I'll have to create the youtube channel later.... That's a bit off though. So that's me, and that's entry one done. I don't want to make these long, they need to be short simple leads. Talk to you next week, maybe sooner. Peace out, A dog </p>
