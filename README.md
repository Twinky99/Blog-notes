  <p><h1> Hunting Wolfs <p/></h1>
  <p><h6><b> Monday, September 22, 2014 </p></h6></b>
  <p>So I had planned on doing this yesterday, but it fell through. It fell so hard that it particularly fell the China. I adressed a few particular issues, first of which, is that this is going to be unedited. I'm doing this unedited, this is raw unedited shit that pours out through my mouth onto my fingers and the weight triggers the keys on my keyboard. Some entries will be short, some will be long but I will try to update this thing at least once a week. Especially with my progress reports. If you like well thought out grammar and sentence structure then please, go away. If you want my personal experiences mixed with an ass load of adventure, mystery and fun. Please, read on. </p>
